# CIND820 Project: Recommendation System Analysis for Yelp
Yiqi WANG

This project uses Yelp dataset and aims to provide the most precise recommendation of Vancouverâ€™s restaurant to the consumers. It will conduct research from the following four aspects:

> 1.The performance of collaborative filtering on the selected database;
> 
> 2.The performance of content-based filtering on the selected database;
> 
> 3.The performance of weighted hybrid filtering (collaborative filtering and content-based filtering) on the selected database;
> 
> 4.Performance comparison and obtain the highest prediction accuracy model.

## 1.1 Prepocessing Steps

(1) Extract Vancouver business information from *business* and match with *review* to get *vancouver_reviews*. 

(2) Filter out Vancouver restaurant reviews(2015 - 2019) to *v_reviews_filtered*. 

(3) Left join *v_reviews_filtered* and *vancouver_business*, which adds business information for each review record(2015 - 2019), to get *reviews_business*.

(4) Collect user id who has rated Vancouver restaurants in selected period(2015 - 2019) and match with user to get related users information *users_data*.

(5) Discard users with review counts over 57 and get *user_filtered*.

(6) Left join *reviews_business* and *user_filtered*, drop review record whose user id is not in the *user_filtered*, and get *reviews_business_users*.

## 2.1 Collaborative Filtering Model

I use Python library Surprise (SVD, SVDpp, KNNBasic) to find the best collaborative filtering model based on RMSE, MAE, and Fit time.
